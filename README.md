# Chang-an-Dataset
We provide a real dataset for unregistered HSI and MSI fusion, named Chang'an. It was collected by our team in Chang'an District, Xi 'an, Shaanxi, China. The Chang'an dataset contains an LR-HSI of size 960 × 960 × 137 collected by Headwall VNIR/SWIR Full band Hyperspectrometer and an HR-MSI (Fig. 1) of size 3840 × 3840 × 3 collected by FLIR Duo Pro R sensor. It is encouraged for the state-of-the-art fusion methods to further explore the application in real scenarios on our dataset.
